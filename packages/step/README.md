3. Error Handling Improvements: Your error handling is already quite good with
   the `ErrorHandlers` interface. Consider adding a way to pass error
   information to subsequent steps or to the final result of the execution. This
   could help in scenarios where you want to continue execution but still report
   errors.

4. Parallel Execution Control: Your implementation allows for parallel execution
   of steps. You might want to add an option to control the level of
   parallelism, especially for scenarios where resource constraints are a
   concern.

5. Step Execution Metrics: Consider adding timing information for each step
   execution. This could be valuable for performance analysis and optimization.

   ```typescript
   private async _start(step: Step<C>, previous?: Step<C>): Promise<void> {
     const startTime = Date.now();
     // ... execution logic ...
     const endTime = Date.now();
     console.log(`Step ${step.name} executed in ${endTime - startTime}ms`);
   }
   ```

6. Step Retries: For steps that might fail due to transient issues, you could
   add a retry mechanism with configurable retry counts and backoff strategies.

7. Dry Run Mode: Implement a "dry run" mode that would simulate the execution of
   steps without actually performing their actions. This could be useful for
   testing and validation.

8. Step Dependencies: While you have before and after queues, you might want to
   consider explicit dependency declarations between steps. This could help in
   automatically constructing the execution order.

9. Execution Snapshots: Implement a way to take snapshots of the execution
   state. This could be useful for long-running processes where you might want
   to resume from a certain point in case of interruptions.

Sure, here are the specific, project-relevant improvement ideas:

1. **Immutable Context Integration:** Ensure the `Step` and `StepExecutor`
   classes fully utilize the immutable context to prevent unintended side
   effects during step execution.

2. **Step Caching Mechanism:** Implement a caching system for steps that are
   repeatedly executed with the same input to avoid redundant computations and
   improve performance.

3. **Priority-Based Graph Traversal:** Enhance the `Graph` class with a
   priority-based traversal mechanism to handle nodes or edges with different
   priorities effectively.

4. **Parallel Step Execution:** Allow `StepExecutor` to execute independent
   steps in parallel to improve execution speed and resource utilization.

5. **Dynamic Step Configuration:** Add the ability to dynamically configure
   steps at runtime based on external inputs or configuration files.

6. **State Management Hooks:** Introduce hooks or callbacks in the `Step` and
   `StepExecutor` classes to manage state transitions and side effects more
   effectively.

7. **Customizable Execution Flow:** Enable customization of the execution flow
   in `StepExecutor` to support different step sequencing logic, such as
   conditional branching.

8. **Graph Serialization:** Implement methods in the `Graph` class to serialize
   and deserialize the graph structure, facilitating persistence and sharing.

9. **Event-Driven Step Execution:** Integrate an event-driven architecture where
   steps can emit and listen to events, allowing for more flexible execution
   patterns.

10. **Error Recovery Mechanism:** Develop a robust error recovery mechanism
    within `StepExecutor` to handle failures gracefully and allow for retries or
    alternative actions.
