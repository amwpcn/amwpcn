### TODO for Step:

0. DOCUMENTATION

1. Step Execution Metrics: Consider adding timing information for each step
   execution. This could be valuable for performance analysis and optimization.

2. Step Retries: For steps that might fail due to transient issues, you could
   add a retry mechanism with configurable retry counts and backoff strategies.

3. Dry Run Mode: Implement a "dry run" mode that would simulate the execution of
   steps without actually performing their actions. This could be useful for
   testing and validation.

4. Execution Snapshots: Implement a way to take snapshots of the execution
   state. This could be useful for long-running processes where you might want
   to resume from a certain point in case of interruptions.

5. **Dynamic Step Configuration:** Add the ability to dynamically configure
   steps at runtime based on external inputs or configuration files.

6. **State Management Hooks:** Introduce hooks or callbacks in the `Step` and
   `StepExecutor` classes to manage state transitions and side effects more
   effectively.

7. **Customizable Execution Flow:** Enable customization of the execution flow
   in `StepExecutor` to support different step sequencing logic, such as
   conditional branching.

8. **Event-Driven Step Execution:** Integrate an event-driven architecture where
   steps can emit and listen to events, allowing for more flexible execution
   patterns.
